## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Testing my first code in R markdown

```{r}
  c(1,2,3,4) -> a

  str(b)
  b = c(1,2,4^2,3:16)
  tmp2 <- "Oscar"
  
  tmp <- b[b>=10]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Summary of the second R session

- select is useful for subsetting columns
- filter is for rows
- mutate is for creating or overrun a column
- you need to library the package to make it work

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
